    "###  Final Note on Python Threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this project uses the `threading` module to parallelize matrix multiplication, it's important to highlight a key limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that even though multiple threads are created, **they do not run in parallel on multiple CPU cores** when performing heavy computations like matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Why threading can be slower:\n",
    "- **Thread creation overhead:** Spawning and managing threads takes time.\n",
    "- **Context switching:** The system must switch between threads, adding latency.\n",
    "- **No CPU-level parallelism:** In standard Python (`CPython`), only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time due to the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### For real performance gains on CPU-bound tasks:\n",
    "Consider using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `multiprocessing` (parallel processes with true CPU core usage)\n",
    "- `numpy` (optimized C-based array operations)\n",
    "- `numba` (JIT compilation)\n",
    "- `cython` or `C++` bindings\n",
    "- Other languages (e.g., Rust, Go, Julia)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as an **introductory exercise** to understand the *concept* of parallelism using threads, and why **threading isn't always faster** — especially in Python.\n"
